# Homework

For the 1st challenge my motivation was to refactor a client's existing webpage, making the existing code concise and web accessible.  Web accessibility ensures people with disabilities can access websites using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.  I modified the existing code to follow the semantic structure of HTML elements and included comments before each element/section of the page to provide clarity for any developer making edits after Iâ€™ve completed the project. 

To follow semantic structure, I changed the divs to sections, added a nav to indicate a navigation bar, added an aside tag to separate unrelated sections from the main section and created a footer tag to properly indicate the existence of a footer.  I also added classes to the HTML to group similar styling and reduce unnecessary coding in CSS.  By adding classes to the HTML, I was also adhering to the Scout Rule by leaving the code cleaner than it was provided to me.

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards by adding descriptive alt tags to images, ensuring disabled users would have access to the page.
WHEN I view the source code in HTML, I can modify it to follow semantic structure and add alt tags to images for web accessibility.
THEN I find semantic HTML elements can be applied, such as replacing divs with sections, adding nav, aside and footer tags, making it easier for other developers to make modifications after I complete the challenge.
WHEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, I can add classes to combine like elements for CSS styling, reducing redundant code.
THEN I find a concise, descriptive code that meets requirements provided by the client.
